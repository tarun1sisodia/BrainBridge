# BrainBridge -  AI Bilingual Learning Disability Screening Platform

# 1. Project Overview

BrainBridge is a gamified AI-powered screening platform designed to detect early indicators of learning disabilities in children aged under 3-13.
Disclaimer :- It is not diagnosis tool for medical advice only detects behavioural screening through patterns including response time, focus attention and other behavioural metrics.

The system evaluates behavioral signals through short interactive games and applies machine learning models to estimate risk for:

* Dyslexia
* Dyscalculia
* ADHD

BrainBridge is designed to be:

* Accessible
* Affordable
* Multilingual
* Aims to  Deploy in schools promoting goverment initiative like DIKSHA/DISHA

It provides screening indicators, not medical diagnoses.
# 2. Problem Statement

Learning disabilities are widespread yet underdiagnosed.

Key Statistics

* Over 4.5 crore children in India are estimated to have learning disabilities.
* 90% remain undiagnosed until age 10+.
* Professional assessments cost ₹20,000–₹25,000.

### Key Challenges BrainBridge aims to resolve

1. Late detection of learning disorders
2. Expensive clinical evaluations
3. Lack of screening tools for schools
4. Language barriers in existing platforms
5. Limited access to specialists

# 3. Proposed Solution

BrainBridge provides a digital screening system where children play simple games while the system measures cognitive behavior.

The system collects cognitive  behavioral signals, processes them using machine learning models, and generates a risk report.
